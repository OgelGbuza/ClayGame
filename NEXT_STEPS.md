# Next Steps in Game Development

This document outlines recommended future improvements for the ClayGame project and summarizes recent enhancements.

## Proposed Features

- **Fullscreen Toggle**: Allow players to toggle fullscreen mode with `F11`. This improves immersion and accessibility for different screen sizes.
- **High Score Display**: Show the saved high score on the main menu so players can see the target to beat.
- **Save/Load Enhancements**: Integrate save and load options into the pause menu.
- **Enemy Variety**: Introduce additional enemy behaviors (e.g., faster movement or unique attack patterns) to increase gameplay depth.
- **Sound and Music**: Expand the audio system with background music tracks and more sound effects.

## Implemented Changes

- Added global `F11` key handling in `main.py` to toggle fullscreen mode at runtime.
- Updated `MainMenu` in `states.py` to display the stored high score.

# ClayGame

This repository contains a small pygame project that was imported from another project. The current state of the code base is somewhat unpolished and many binary and IDE files were previously tracked.

## Running

The project requires Python 3 and the `pygame` package. Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the game using:

```bash
python main.py
```

Press `F11` while the game is running to toggle fullscreen. The main menu now shows your saved high score.

## Development

Compiled Python files (`__pycache__`) and IDE settings are ignored using `.gitignore`. Feel free to open issues or pull requests with improvements.
